# niphlem

*niphlem* is a toolbox that extracts physiological recordings during MRI scanning and estimates the signal phases so that they can be used as a covariate in your general linear model (GLM) with fMRI data.

*niphlem* can generate multiple models of physiological noise to include as regressors in your GLM model from either ECG, pneumatic breathing belt or pulse-oximetry data.  These are described in Verstynen and Deshpande (2011).

Briefly, niphlem implements two physiological models for regressors generation:

- *RETROICOR*:  A phasic decomposition method that isolates the fourier series that best describes the spectral properties of the input signal.  This was first described by Glover and colleagues. 
- *Variation Models*:  For low frequency signals (like the pneumatic belt and low-pass filtered pulse-oximetry) this does the combined respiration variance and response function described by Birn and colleagues (2008).  For high frequency signals (i.e., ECG or high-pass filtered pulse-oximetry), this generates the heart-rate variance and cardiac response function described by Chang and colleagues (2009).

*niphlem* can also extract cardiac and respiratory signals from the pulse-oximitry data stream itself, as described in Verstynen and Deshpande (2011).
