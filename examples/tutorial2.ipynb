    "- The first argument, *data_file*, is a path to the file that contains the data that we want to load. According to BIDS specs, physiological recordings' filenames with the data should use the \"\\_physio\" suffix and be a gzip compressed TSV file. Therefore, they should end with \"\\_physio.tsv.gz\" and niphlem will prompt an error if they are not so. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The second argument is a json sidecar file that contains meta information about the data. Again, according to BIDS, this should be a json file and contain at least three required fields: \"SamplingFrequency\", \"StartTime\" and \"Columns\". Niphlem thus checks that one passes a json file and that these fields are presented. It also checks that the number of names in \"Columns\" is the same as the number of columns in the data, otherwise it gives a warning message.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The third argument, *resample_freq*, is optional and allows you to resample the data to a given frequency. It is common that different physiological recordings are acquired at different frequencies, so this parameter allows the user to be able to have all the recordings at the same frequency. \n",
