1-Intro to Niphlem
====================

1.1- What is Niphlem?
------------------------

*Niphlem* is a toolbox designed to preprocess phsyiological signals collected during MRI scannings. It is able to estimate covariates from these recordings that can be used later in general linear model (GLM) analyses of fMRI data.

It is written in Python, with the aim of being simple and flexible. Such flexibility thus assumes a very basic knowledge of Python. If you do not feel confortable or are not familiar with this programming language, we recommed that you learn at least the most basic notions. For example, a good source for this may be the `scipy lecture notes <http://scipy-lectures.org/>`_.

Alternatively, Matlab users may be more interested in using PhLEM, which is what *niphlem* is based on. Check `PhLEM Toolbox <https://sites.google.com/site/phlemtoolbox/>`_ for more details on this toolbox.

1.2- Installing niphlem
------------------------

*niphlem* can be easily installed through pypi as follows::

    pip install -U niphlem

The dependencies, beyond those libraries that come with python distributions, are numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn and outlier_utils. All of these are checked and installed if missing when installing *niphlem*.

Alternatively, if you are interested in installing the latest version under development, you may clone the github repository and install it from there directly::

    git clone https://github.com/CoAxLab/niphlem.git
    cd niphlem
    pip install -U .


2-Physiological Signal
======================

*Niphlem* is particularly designed to exctract physiological signal (cardiac, respiration) from electrocardiogram (ECG), pneumatic belt or pulse oximeter (pulse-ox) data recordings.

Right now, *niphlem* is able to work with physiological data in the form of log files acquired through a Multi-Band accelerated EPI Pulse sequence (visit `<https://www.cmrr.umn.edu/multiband>`_ for more details), and data in BIDS compliance. In the future, more formats of input physiological data will be incorporated.

3-RETROICOR Models
====================

RETROICOR stands for Retrospective Image Correction and it calculates the fourier series expansion using the phases from the cardiac and respiratory cycles.

The algorithm in these models works as follows:

1. Extract the peaks in the physiological data. In the case of cardiac, signals these would correspond to the R components of the QRS complex. In the pneumatic belt signal, they would correspond to the peak expansion of the diaphragm. And for pulse-ox signals, the maxima in local blood oxygenation.

2. Estimation of a phase time to be between 0 and 2Ï€ between consecutive time peaks :math:`t_1` and :math:`t_2`, i.e., as having full phase cycles:

.. math::

   \phi(t) = \frac{2\pi (t - t_1)}{(t_2-t_1)}

3. Computation of sines and cosines of these phases up to a specified order, i.e. :math:`[sin(k\cdot\phi(t)), cos(k\cdot\phi(t))]`, with :math:`k=1,2,\dots`
4. Downsampling each of these terms to the scanner time resolution.

After these four steps, we obtain a series of phase regressors that we can use in our fMRI models to account for the physiological signal.

Niphlem has a class `RetroicorPhysio <https://coaxlab.github.io/niphlem/api.html#niphlem.models.RetroicorPhysio>`_, which preprocesses the initial data (transform and filter) and implements this algorithm to generate such regressors. For a detailed example of how to use this class, we recommend visiting the `tutorial 3 <https://coaxlab.github.io/niphlem/tutorials/tutorial3.html>`_ and `tutorial 4 <https://coaxlab.github.io/niphlem/tutorials/tutorial4.html>`_.

4-Variation Models
====================

Niphlem can also generate nuisance regressors for variations in breathing rate/volume and heart rate.


4.1- Variations in breathing rate/volume regressors
------------------------------------------------------------

The algorithm for variations in breathing rate/volume is as follows:

1. Computation of the standard deviation of the signal within a time window centered at each TR. Such a time window has been usually taken as 3*TR long (Chang, 2009). This operation thus yields a time series at the scanner acquisition time resolution.
2. Z-score normalization.
3. Convolution with the respiratory response function (RRF(t)), which reads:

.. math::

   RRF(t) = 0.6 t^{2.1} e^{-t/1.6} - 0.0023 t^{3.54} e^{-t/4.25}


Niphlem has a class `RVPhysio <https://coaxlab.github.io/niphlem/api.html#niphlem.models.RVPhysio>`_, which preprocesses the initial data (transform and filter) and implements this algorithm to generate such regressors. For a detailed example of how to use this class, we recommend visiting the `tutorial 3 <https://coaxlab.github.io/niphlem/tutorials/tutorial3.html>`_ and `tutorial 4 <https://coaxlab.github.io/niphlem/tutorials/tutorial4.html>`_.

4.2- Variations in heart rate regressors
------------------------------------------------------------

The algorithm for variations in heart rate is as follows:

1. Computation of the average deviation in inter-event interval (i.e., ms between R-components of the QRS complex), per second,  within a time window centered at each TR. Such a time window has been usually taken as 3*TR long (Chang, 2009). This operation thus yields a time series at the scanner acquisition time resolution.
2. Z-score normalization.
3. Convolution with the respiratory response function (CRF(t)), which reads:

.. math::

   CRF(t) = 0.6 t^{2.7}e^{-t/1.6} - \frac{16}{\sqrt{18 \pi }}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\frac{(t-12)^2}{9}}

Niphlem has a class `HVPhysio <https://coaxlab.github.io/niphlem/api.html#niphlem.models.HVPhysio>`_, which preprocesses the initial data (transform and filter) and implements this algorithm to generate such regressors. For a detailed example of how to use this class, we recommend visiting the `tutorial 3 <https://coaxlab.github.io/niphlem/tutorials/tutorial3.html>`_ and `tutorial 4 <https://coaxlab.github.io/niphlem/tutorials/tutorial4.html>`_.
